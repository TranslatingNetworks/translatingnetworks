[_Thomas O. Beebee_](http://complit.la.psu.edu/people/tob) is Edwin Erle Sparks Professor of Comparative Literature and German at Penn State University.Translation and translation studies have anchored Tom's scholarly life, as other topics and interests grew arabesquely around these pillars. His most recent contribution to critical translation studies has been the 2012 monograph _Transmesis_, which compares fictional representations of translation and of translators in a variety of languages and traditions. Tom is also interested in big data, scalar reading, macroanalysis, and empirical studies of literature.

_Sean Weidman_ is a PhD candidate in English at Pennsylvania State University, where his research interests are focused in the fields of modernism, Irish literature, and the digital humanities.
