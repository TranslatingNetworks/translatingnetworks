**Translating Networks** is a project of Dawn Childress (UCLA) and Thomas O. Beebee (Penn State) to explore the communities, connections, and important players in contemporary literary translation. The project also serves as a sandbox to better understand network analysis, graph theory, and the relevant tools.
