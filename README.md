# Translating Networks

This repo contains the source files for the **Translating Networks** project homepage, an experiment of Dawn Childress (UCLA) and Thomas O. Beebee (Penn State) to explore the communities, connections, and important players in contemporary literary translation. The project also serves as a sandbox to better understand network analysis, graph theory, and the relevant tools.

For questions questions or comments, contact Dawn Childress at kirschbombe@gmail.com.
